## Geomstats for Graph Classification

This example shows how to leverage the Riemannian geometry for a brain connectome  classification challenge. The dataset consists in the resting-state fMRIs of 86 patients  at 28 Regions Of Interest (ROIs), and the goal is to compare  and classify the induced graph regularized laplacians (a special case of SPD matrices).

# Running the example
```
# Install dependencies
python3 install -r requirements.txt
python3 spd_fmri.py
```
